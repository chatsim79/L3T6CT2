      <h1>Paul Reed Smith (PRS) McCarty Trem</h1>
      <p>This guitar was developed with the assistance of Ted McCarty, the Vice President, then President of 
         Gibson Guitars during it's "golden age" in the 50s and 60s, during which most of Gibson's most iconic guitars were produced. 
         The PRS McCarty was an attempt to bring some qualities of the Gibson Les Paul model, to PRS. </p>
      <p>This model was from what was called a "Dealer Special Run" where, with large orders, a dealer can specify certain details on 
         the guitar. In this case the colour (Teal Black), the "top" (wood used for the front of the guitar) and the tremolo (or whammy/wang bar)
          were all special options chosen by the dealer. The top in particular is another example of the disease mentioned on the 
          Musicman Page, this time resulting in a striped rather than quilted pattern. It's also an example of what PRS call a "10 top", 
          representing the best visual quality of figured wood they have in stock.</p>
