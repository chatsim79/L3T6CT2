## L3T6CT2.

#Description:

This repository contains the files for Level 2 Task 23, as requested in 
compulsory task 2 of Level 3 Task 6. The purpose of this task is to show 
the ability to write a readme file and push a project to a remote 
repository. As always, if anything would lose me marks, please fail me and 
I'll resub with corrections.

# 1 - Installation:

N/A as the purpose of the task is is not to make a Django Project work 
within github, which is outside the scope of the Task. In any case, i 
tried this a few nights ago and still haven't got it to work as of yet. 
It is not simply a matter of uploading the Django project directory and 
letting github publish it. I aim to be able to do this soon though. 
However, there's no reason you couldn't create a Django virtual environment folder
on your local machine, clone this repo to it and open up the "L1T23CompTask" 
folder nested in the main directory in VSC.

# 2 - Usage:

Not sure, I've only ever run it inside VSC, but if you do the above and open the
L1T23CompTask in VSC. However if you perform the above installation instructions,
you should only need to open up a command line in vsc and run:

python manage.py runserver
