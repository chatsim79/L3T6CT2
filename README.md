This repository contains the files for Level 2 Task 23, as requested in 
compulsory task 2 of Level 3 Task 6. The purpose of this task is to show 
the ability to write a readme file and push a project to a remote 
repository. As always, if anything would lose me marks, please fail me and I'll resub with corrections.

#Table of Contents:

N/A as the purpose of the task is is not to make a Django Project work 
within github, which is outside the scope of the Task. 

#Installation:

N/A as the purpose of the task is is not to make a Django Project work 
within github, which is outside the scope of the Task. In any case, i 
tried this a few nights ago and still haven't got it to work as of yet. 
It is not simply a matter of uploading the Django project directory and 
letting github publish it. I aim to be able to do this soon though.

#Usage:

Not sure, I've only ever run it inside VSC
